# SGAN-File-Classier
File classifier based on an adversarially-trained MLP classifier

Correctly identifying the type of file under examination is a critical part of a forensic investigation.  The file type alone suggests the embedded content, such as a picture, video, manuscript, spreadsheet, etc.  In cases where a system owner might desire to keep their files inaccessible or file type concealed, we propose using an adversarially-trained machine learning neural network to determine a file's true type even if the extension is obfuscated to complicate its discovery.  Our semi-supervised generative adversarial network achieved 96.5% accuracy in classifying files across 11 different types.  We also compared our network against a traditional standalone neural network and three other machine learning algorithms.  The adversarially-trained network proved to be the most precise file classifier especially in scenarios with few supervised samples available.
